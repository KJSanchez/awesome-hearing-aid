# TODO:
- How do you measure aurual cognition?
- How do model a hearing aid prescription?
- How is the noise suppression different from the air pods pro, bose head phones, or even Zoom?
- How do you model the acoustic landscape?
- How do you implement a hearing aid prescription?
- How do I optimize my dev environment for real time audio?
- How do I test a hearing aid implementation locally?
